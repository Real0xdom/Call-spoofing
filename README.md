there are various route providers to A to Z countries but one of the best I liked is 

And to my surprise, the following provider has made a web app for this so you can use it without any problem, you can go to the website create an account, and use it.
It will provide you sip server address and log into your portsSIP softphone with that sip server address and your user ID and password.

there are other SIP trunk route providers as well some of them might offer a minimum rate, but you have to message them on telegram and ask for which countries they provide and at what rate.
they will provide you SIP Server address, User ID, and Password.

if none of them responds you can message in any of the below groups and ask for a route for spoofing to certain countries and they'll message you, also be aware of scammers to confirm you can ask for test credit from them and they'll give you small credit which you can use to log into your portsip softphone and make the call if you confirm it works then only you can purchase from them.
